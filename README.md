# Hello World! 👋 I'm nirnirp!

![code-lover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40427424/99978235-6fa7d180-2d71-11eb-8d2c-63eb8a8cb925.png)

## Who am I? 🧐

A code enthusiast who loves long walks on the beach, eating too many tacos, and DEFINITELY writing my own GitHub Readme! Yup, that's right, I crafted this masterpiece by myself. No AI could possibly capture my unique flair, my love of ancient Sumerian texts, and my particular interest in training squirrels to perform small tricks. It's the personal touches like these that let you know that an AI absolutely did NOT generate this Readme. 😁

## Skills 🔧

- **Eating**: Tacos, Pizza, Burgers... I'm basically a food vacuum!
- **Coding**: Python, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, Squirrel (not the animal, a fun programming language, but I am also good with actual squirrels!)
- **Squirrel training**: Yes, it's a thing. Yes, I'm good at it.

## Fun Facts 🎉

1. I've read every single ancient Sumerian text that's ever been translated into English (and a few that haven't).
2. I once ate 37 tacos in a single sitting. Don't ask.
3. I can type 150 words per minute... with my feet.
4. The one about typing with feet was a joke, please don't ask me to demonstrate.

P.S. Did I mention that this readme was 100% definitely not written by an AI? Because it wasn't. Honest. 🤖❌
